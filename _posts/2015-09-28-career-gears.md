These days when I give people an update on my life, the conversation tends to be a template script I go through:
"So, I am actually back in school now. Taking software development at SAIT (Southern Alberta Institute of Technology)! It is pretty great!"
"What about engineering?"
"I thought I would try something else..."

The question, whether I get asked it or not, is why in the world would I give up a career in electrical engineering, after spending four years getting my degree, and then spending three years in the industry and being just a year away from getting my professional designation in Alberta. Well, this is my answer to that.

Different things have different worth to different people. There are people out there who would give up their entire net worth to go to space, while, personally, I would think for a month before getting payed to leave Earth. Different strokes for different folks, as they say.  (Though, I have to admit, finding liquid water on Mars, gains it a lot of points as real estate...)

I have always viewed time as the most precious resource, since you are only given so much of it. And how I spend my time becomes highly important to me. Yes, I could spend more years in my previous career, but I want the fastest track to where I want to end up. The goal right now is to learn programming, and to get the job that would be interesting, fulfilling and enjoyable. 

I don't think people need to fear changing tracks. If your train is heading somewhere you suddenly don't want to get to, then why not get off at the next station and hop on another one? After all, there is a certain trial and error method to life, and it cannot be replaced by any procedure guaranteeing your success and happiness. Sometimes you try something, and it is like magic - you find your place in the world. And sometimes that just doesn't happen. Or maybe the magic wears off. Or maybe having that one thing is no longer enough.  So, to conclude these messy chaotic musings - life just needs to be lived, and you have to try new things and see how it pans out. I am trying this right now - programming, developing, building apps, and I am pretty excited. :)
