	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>An aspiring software developer who dreams in code and all the genius software applications I will build. 
	<p>I am currently finishing a college certificate program in software development, as I have deemed my
	Bachelor degree in engineering insufficient in my aspirations to conquer at least a small part of the world.</p>
	<p>Why blog? Has it not gone out of vogue?</p>
	<p>I don't think it has, I love this medium of self-expression. I might prefer podcasts (there is an odd
	feeling of kinship that you start to develop to strangers if you listen to them tell you enough stories...)</p>
	<p>The reason for this blog, at this point in my life, is to follow my career change journey into the world 
	of programming. Explaining the new concepts I learn would be a great way to cement my new knowledge, ensure
	my full comprehension of it, and, hopefully, to help some other soul along their learning journey.</p>
	<p>Blogging has many other benefits, and some of the most compelling ones, I have found here, at 
	<a href="http://www.becomingminimalist.com/15-reasons-i-think-you-should-blog/">Becoming Minimalist</a>.
	Check it out if curious.</p>
